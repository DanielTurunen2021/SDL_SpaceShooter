Hi David!

Sadly, I was unable to make the space shooter as feature complete as I would have liked(there is 0 audio) and only 1 row of enemies. I did the best I could given my current circumstances but I feel like I have been run over by a truck. Either way, the game itself works like a game should! It has enemies, a player and the player can shoot bullets to destroy the enemies.

use A&D to move.
hold SPACE to fire


I was pondering wether Quicksort would have been useful in this project(I know you have a pivot to sort your things, I just didn't understand what the pivot would be in a list of enemies, perhaps sorting them in "active" and "inactive" ones?). I did not have enough time to ponder how to optimize the code since I had a lot of trouble getting my collisions to work(turns out I was still updating enemy and projectile positions after the enemies were dead) and I also had trouble figuring out why collision checking only worked for the first 10 enemies but not more(which has also been solved). 

At least function calls should not happen if the enemy or player are no longer alive.

Have a wonderful christmas! :)
